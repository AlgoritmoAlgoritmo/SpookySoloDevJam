# SpookySoloDevJam

ABOUT THIS
----------
It's an abbandoned project I intended to make for the
Solo Dev Game Jam #5 - Spooky jam 
(https://itch.io/jam/solo-dev-game-jam-5-spooky-jam).

The reason why I'm quitting at around 50% of 
completition is that I just can't ressonate with the
theme (Fight The Dark) nor the horror genre.


The Concept:
------------
A game in which the player has to survive until morning
by keeping the lights of the house on as much as 
possible, to avoid enemies to spawn in the darkness,
while said lights fail and turn off constantly.
The player's flashlight can damage enemies, but there
aren't any other batteries left, so they have to use
it wisely.


What I achieved:
- First person view/controls
- Flashlight's controls plus battery mechanic
- Game time limit (only logic)
- House collisions
- Lights with auto turn off logic
- Lights' interactable switches
